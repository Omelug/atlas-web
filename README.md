# atlas-web



There are lot of things in this project, that should be done.
So there are some temporary solutions.
## Start - Installation, database connection
```
sudo git clone https://gitlab.com/gymtrebon/zaverecky/vjanecek/atlas-web.git
DBeaver - create a database by default tepmlate1 (default database is public)
        SELECT current_database(); should give you database name
        CREATE schema config
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA config TO <database user>;
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA public TO <database user>;
start -> config tables will be created (in AtlassApplication true/false/false)
start -> first connections (in AtlassApplication false/true/false)
start -> go to localhost>8081/home
start -> you can upload first data with (in AtlassApplication false/true/true) *Opional
